# Berlato_Stefano_Bachelor_Thesis

Bachelor Thesis, Computer Science, University of Trento - DISI, 2017
Supervisor: Brunato Mauro
Student: Berlato Stefano
Title: Development of a Web-based Interface for the Orchestration of Machine Learning Components

Read the thesis in the tesiConCopertina.pdf file

To run the code, unzip thesis.zip and run, using nodejs, server.js

Please notice that this is an incomplete project, since the thesis verged on the creation of the interface rather than the actual implementation of the components (to be done by other students)
